# Instructions

Have `docker` installed.

## Build

Build the docker image with:

```bash
docker build -t httpc .
```

It's going to take a little bit of time to download and build.

## Run
To run the image:

```
docker run --rm httpc <args>
```

The `<args>` will behave like if you did `java httpc <args>`
